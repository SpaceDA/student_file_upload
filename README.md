# student_file_upload
Short python script to read a file name and upload it to a student's folder. In order for this to work you'll have to make sure your destination folders and source files are named
like mine are, or change the code. 

For this script, all of the files I want to upload are named like this: WorkGroup_2-digit grad year_LAST NAME. Ex: MOC_22_SMITH. 
All of my destination folders are labeled by the student's last name, in all CAPS.
